# 3D Snake
Snake Game, but in 3D

## Quick Start
```console
$ cc -o nob nob.c
$ ./nob run
```

## Controls
- `w`: forward
- `a`: left
- `s`: backward
- `d`: right
- `<up>`: up
- `<down>`: down
- `<space>`: rotate camera (note that it doesn't rotate the controls along with the camera, so you might get weird controls)
- `<esc>`: exit

The final score is printed to stdout after you lose or quit the game
